# **Graphene-based Energy Harvesting**

#### *Supervisor : Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan, Dept. of EE, IIT Bombay*

The goal of the project was to design a graphene-based MEMS device harvesting ambient vibrations using a variational capacitor. Housed in this repository are the presentations summarizing the literature survey regarding Mechanical Properties of Graphene Ripples, Energy Harvesting Circuits and Electret Materials, results of basic COMSOL Simulations and a Numerical Simulation of an approximate model described by a set of Ito-Langevin Stochastic Differential Equations to predict equilibrium behaviour of such a device.
